Been a hectic month. I updated the website some more, and I am currently working on a thing with Ashrith but not doing very well with it. So, yeah. Just doing stuff.

I did a couple of workshops as part of a team from work over the past few weeks too. BVM in Anand and VIIT in Pune. AI/ML and DL, with my portion of the workshop being APIs, applications, practical considerations, and crowd work. So yeah, that was fun! Also very exhausting.

This week has been Diwali week, vacation time. It's been relaxation for the most part, although I do not feel particularly relaxed. Just getting by for now.

Let's see what the future holds, I guess. Going to try and work properly on the little project that I've taken up with Ashrith.

End of line.
