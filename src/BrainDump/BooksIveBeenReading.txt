So, I'm not sure how to structure this information. Maybe I'll keep it in this table for now, and then split this part into fic/non-fic or some genre-based split eventually, when there are enough books to necessitate that sort of a sitch. 

I'm also only going to keep books I've been reading from about a week before the time of publishing for this page, and then any books I've read before that I can add once I revisit them, and any new books I read can be added in as needed. And a journal-based backlinking system with the dates would be cool as well, but I'd rather not get ahead of myself just yet with all those possibilities.
