Hi! Suraj here. I'm a software engineer, of sorts, still learning the ropes. I work in python, working on backend services of different types like HTTP API servers and plumbing for automation and working with microservices and profiling performance and other odds and ends like that. I've been working for a few years, since mid-2018. I liked what I've been working on, mostly.

This is my website. It's nothing professional, or nice. But it is mine. I'll put up more here, eventually. For now, I think, this is fine. I use [zim-desktop-wiki](http://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki) to maintain the content for this site as a notebook, and I periodically publish my changes by exporting the notebook's contents as a static website, served by nginx using the nginx alpine Docker image as a base for an instance running on [fly.io](https://fly.io). I think the setup for this is pretty nice and I love working with the CLI tool for fly on my local for quickly getting changes deployed. It's great seeing how insanely smooth running my own simple website on the internet can be.

Anyway, here's a basic set of links to take you to the root-level subsections of this notebook/website:
[:Blog](./Blog.md)
[:Garden](./Garden.md)
[:BrainDump](./BrainDump.md)

Also: In case you're wondering why this isn't a fancier website, here's an image I found on twitter (I think) that explains my feelings about the matter on most days:
