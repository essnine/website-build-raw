# Garden
Created Thursday 01 September 2022

I don't know. I want this to be a happy space. Like, a go-to spot for feeling a little better. The mind's place to unclench its jaw, loosen its shoulders. You get the idea.

Maybe to put it in a little more detail, it's something along the lines of what's in [this](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) article. A place *pour moi et mon desir de "cultiver son jardin int√©rieur"*, such that it is.
