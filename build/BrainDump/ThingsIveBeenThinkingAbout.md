# ThingsIveBeenThinkingAbout
Created Wednesday 07 September 2022

There's a few things in that regard actually, and most of them involve reading. A lot of reading, maybe.


* How do Python's Futures work?
* What does a complete Pharo Smalltalk application look like?
* How would I go about setting up a websocket server in Elixir?
* How would I go about picking up a Lisp? Which Lisp would be right to start with? I've tried to tangle with Scheme and Common Lisp in the past, but just couldn't, for one reason or another.
* Should I think about applying at the Recurse Center in a year or two? If not the Recurse Center, is there something else I could try and find to better myself as a programmer?



There's more things I feel like asking the world in general, because I have no clue why it is this way:

* Why do 15" laptops generally have worse keyboards than 14" laptops in the same price range?
* I'm sure I'll think of more. Just that the first one has been bothering me extra badly.
