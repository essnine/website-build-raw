# TVShows
Created Sunday 11 September 2022

I watch a fair number shows over the span of a year, so I don't know what good it'd do to write about them all. Instead, this section is about TV shows that I really like, the demarcation line being that I start reading trivia and meta-content about the show, from production notes to commentaries to (sometimes) fanfics.
