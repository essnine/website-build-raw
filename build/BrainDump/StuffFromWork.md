I work as a software engineer, at [smartSense Solutions](https://smartsensesolutions.com). As of now, I've been working with them for a year and a half. The work is interesting, since there is a bit of a transition going from a bootstrapped product startup to a boostrapped consulting services firm, and there's a fair amount of learning and relearning I've had to do for a bit now.
