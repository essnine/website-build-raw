I don't know if I want pagination here. Maybe just a page with stuff and timestamps. Update 05-09-2022: maybe adding child pages for subtopics is one way to make it work.

It's been a long day. But hey, I finally figured out how to get the website done with. I guess I should stop looking at Python (and Flask in some respects) as my go-to tools. There's more than one way to skin a lamb, or so the saying goes (I think). The static website is up using nginx, and it's running fine. I can add a python script to update it from a git repo if I want to make the updates a little more dynamic, although maybe a good place to start would be getting into the habit of writing daily (and before midnight passes).
	
I should see about combining this notebook with the site notebook and then setting up the export mechanism to only export the stuff I want on the website. Or maybe some way to select portions of the journal I keep here and then publish just that. Just something to think about.

Added a little more to the things I've been thinking about. Also, should I be dumping a raw or markdown version of this site to store on GIthub or something?

I added the markdown version yesterday. It's on gitlab, private for now, but I'll see what to do with it later.
